<h1>Adding Experiments</h1>
<p>Fluorescence data can be added to qPCRtoolkit as files in RDML
format (.rdml or .lc96p). To add files click Choose File at
Experiments tab. Multiply files can be uploaded (one by one) for
usage at one analysis. Run data of each uploaded file is listed at
Experiments tab. Unchecking of this data is results in excluding
corresponding experiment from analysis. Samples conditions for
experiments from devices except LightCycler 96 should added to
samples names as SAMPLE_NAME@CONDITION.</p>
<p>Click Example File to load example which can be used as example for absolute and relative quantification.</p
<h1>Performing Absolute Quantification</h1>
<p>This analysis can be done on the Absolute Quantification tab.</p>
<h1>Sidebar panel:</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Limit Cycles — limits min and max cycle to analyse. All
	fluorescence points below min cycle and upper max cycle will be
	omitted. If one of experiments has less cycles than max cycle then
	fluorescence data point will be added (same as last available).</p>
	<li><p>Background Cycles — min and max cycle to use as background
	(is displayed on the Amplification Plot as gray vertical bar).</p>
	<li><p>Apply Background Substraction — use or do not use
	background substraction.</p>
	<li><p>Threshold TARGET_NAME — threshold level for each target in
	analysis (is displayed on the Amplification Plot as horisontal lines
	colored as targets).</p>
	<li><p>Show — selects type of plot to view: amplification of
	calibration.</p>
	<li><p>Targets — selects which targets will be shown.</p>
	<li><p>Export .xlsx — exports all data from Results Table as
	Excell file.</p>
</ul>
<h1>Main panel:</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Amplification or calibration plot</p>
	<li><p>Amplification Plot — shows amplications curves colored by
	type of sample or target.</p>
	<li><p>Calibration Plot — shows calibration curves. And results of
	efficiency calculations.</p>
	<li><p>Plate View — shows plate for each experiment. Clicking on
	cell selects curve to view.</p>
	<li><p>Results Table — represents information abput samples and
	calculated values.</p>
</ul>
<h1>Performing Relative Quantification</h1>
<p>Absolute quantification should be performed before relative
quantification.</p>
<h1>Sidebar panel:</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Reference Genes — selects reference genes to use in
	analysis.</p>
	<li><p>Run Calibrator — selects sample to use as run calibrator —
	calibrator between experiments (select Cal for example file).</p>
	<li><p>Study Calibrator — selects condition to use as calibrator
	inside analysis (select 0h for example file)</p>
	<li><p>Show Targets — which targets will be shown on Bar Plot.</p>
	<li><p>Show Samples — which samples will be shown on Bar Plot.</p>
	<li><p>Show Conditions — which conditions will be shown on Bar
	Plot.</p>
	<li><p>Split By — defines in which order results on Bar Plot will
	be separated.</p>
	<li><p>Show Ratio — selects type of analysis to show on Bar Plot:
	Relative, Normalized (Run Calibrator should be defined), Scaled
	(Study Calibrator should be defined).</p>
	<li><p>Y-Axis Type — log or linear y-axis.</p>
	<li><p>Show Errors — show errors of calculation on Bar Plot if
	checked.</p>
	<li><p>Export .xlsx — exports all data from Results Table as
	Excell file.</p>
</ul>
<h1>Main panel:</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Bar Plot — mean values of calculated ratios.</p>
	<li><p>Results Table — represents information abput samples and
	calculated values.</p>
</ul>
